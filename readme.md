Ultra small PC consisting of:
- LattePanda Sigma with 32GB RAM and Intel Core i5
- one TB of NVME PCIE 4
- m.2 WiFi / Bluetooth card and antennae 
- Zotac NVIDIA GTX 1080ti with 11GB VRAM 
- NFHK PCI-E 3.0 M.2 M-Key to Oculink SFF-8612 SFF-8611 Host Adapter
- BeQuiet! SFX Power 3 450W PSU.

I removed the metal back plate of the GPU.

I'm printing in PETG on a Prusa MK3i

The design files here are:
- baseplate for mouting the Oculink adapter, LattePanda, PSU and GPU
- headplate for mounting PSU, lattePanda and GPU
- Antenna Plate for holding the antennae, this is screwed to the headplate via the screws for the lattePanda

If you build this machine, please tell me your experience and suggest improvements
